            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>I've had an internship at the <a href="https://www.collincountytx.gov/Government/Information-Technology" target="_blank">Collin County IT department</a>. We replaced a fifth of the county's hardware with newer technology and brought the old equipment back to be auctioned off. After completing the project I was invited back the following summer to do it again. This time, I learned <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/" target="_blank">powershell</a> to create scripts to automate software aspects of computer replacement as well as modifying the scripts that place computer images to make that process far faster. Due to the newly enhanced processes, we completed the project a month earlier than it took the year before.</p>
            <p>In my Computer Organization class, my group built a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/microprocessor" target="_blank">microprocessor</a> composed from simple logic gates and wires with assembly code to run on it. In another class, Data Structures and Algorithms, I designed classes for data structures such as vectors, linked lists, binary seach trees, hashmaps, and graphs. On the side I have done a professional speaking class, which involved research into technical subjects for presentation and have done significant creative writing.</p>
            <p>I have developed games or mods on my own as I have wanted such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe</a> with settings like a chess clock and blindfold mode. For another noteable example I learned the Minecraft command language to make customized mods as each player requested on a privately hosted server.</p>
            <p>Moving forwards, I intend on creating an online <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/database" target="_blank">database</a>, as most aspects of software development seem to require one to a relevant extent. Fortunately, this will be explored in greater detail in my Foundations of Software Engineering class. I intend on taking all of the classes required for a <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/computer-science/cybersecurity-minor/" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Minor</a> as well, though I cannot officially get it due to already having two other minors. I would earnestly search for any research opportunities, as that kind of problem solving and discovery is something I find particularly appealing.</p>
